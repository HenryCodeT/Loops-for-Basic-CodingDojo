# Loops-for-Basic-CodingDojo
### Python-Fundamentals-Fundamentals
### goals
* Learn to use basic for statements in Python
* Practice basic algorithms in Python
* Create a Python file named loop_for_basic1.py that performs the following tasks.

** Basic: prints all integers from 0 to 150.
** Multiples of Five: Prints all multiples of 5 between 5 and 1,000.
** Counting, the Dojo way: prints integers from 1 to 100. If divisible by 5, prints "Coding" instead. If divisible by 10, prints "Coding Dojo".
** Whoa. It's a great idiot: it adds the odd integers from 0 to 500,000, and prints the final sum.
** Countdown by 4: Print positive numbers starting from 2018, counting down from 4 by 4.
** Flexible Counter : Set three variables: lowNum, highNum, mult. Starting at lowNum and going through highNum, print only integers that are multiples of mult. For example, if lowNum=2, highNum=9, and mult=3. The loop should print 3, 6, 9 (on successive lines).
